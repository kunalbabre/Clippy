# Product Requirements Document: Clippy AI Desktop Assistant

## 1. Problem Statement

### Why This Product?
Modern users face a disconnect between the nostalgic, friendly computing experience of the 1990s and today's powerful AI capabilities. Current AI assistants are either cloud-dependent (raising privacy concerns) or lack the engaging, personality-driven interface that made computing feel approachable and fun.

### Target Problem
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users want AI assistance without sending data to external services
- **Engagement Gap**: Modern AI interfaces lack personality and emotional connection
- **Complexity Barrier**: Advanced AI tools intimidate casual users who need simple, friendly interaction
- **Nostalgia Market**: Growing demand for retro computing experiences with modern capabilities

### Success Metrics
- **Primary KPI**: User engagement time (target: 15+ minutes daily active usage)
- **Secondary KPIs**: 
  - User retention rate (target: 70% weekly retention)
  - Privacy satisfaction score (target: 9/10)
  - Feature adoption rate (target: 80% of users use AI chat within first week)

## 2. User Personas
